# OBSOLESCENCE NOTICE
NeoHanega was based on GIMI v7.x, an older version that is no longer maintained. Development efforts have moved to GIMI v8.x, with a launcher already existing for it: XXMI Launcher.
It does everything NeoHanega did, plus its auto updating and more modern.
If you are looking for a similar experience, move to that. 

Thanks for downloading and using NeoHanega.

# NeoHanega
Easily launch a modded version of Genshin Impact (with [GI-Model-Importer](https://github.com/SilentNightSound/GI-Model-Importer)) in a single click using **NeoHanega**â€”a **Windows-exclusive** tool designed for convenience.

**NeoHanega** is a lightweight bootstrapper that prepares and launches larger applications seamlessly. It simplifies the process of starting *GIMI/3DMigoto* and *Genshin Impact* by creating a desktop shortcut that launches both applications in the correct sequence with one click. NeoHanega ensures *GIMI* starts before *Genshin Impact* for optimal performance.
Additionally, it removes the "Run as Admin" prompts typically required when launching *GIMI* and *Genshin Impact*, further streamlining the experience.

## Requirements
To function correctly, **NeoHanega** requires:
- A computer running Windows 10 or later.
- .NET Desktop Runtime 8.0.0 (which can be downloaded [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-8.0.0-windows-x64-installer)).
- The latest version of Genshin Impact installed.
- The latest version of [GI-Model-Importer](https://github.com/SilentNightSound/GI-Model-Importer) installed.

## Getting Started
To get started, download the [latest release](https://github.com/ProsD03/NeoHanega/releases) and extract it in a permanent location, like the *Documents* folder.

After that, launch NeoHanega. The following window will appear:

Press "Select..." for both *3DMigoto* (*GIMI*) and *Genshin Impact*, then choose the appropriate executable file. For *3DMigoto*, select `3DMigoto Loader.exe`; for *Genshin Impact*, select `GenshinImpact.exe` (***IMPORTANT: Select the Genshin Impact game executable, not its launcher.***).<br>
Optionally, check the "Remove 'Run as Admin' pop-up?" box. When everything is set, press OK and follow the on-screen instructions.

Once installed, use the "Launch NeoHanega" shortcut on your desktop (feel free to move it to any location) and enjoy!

## Features
- Simple user interface to configure the tool.
- Automatic Genshin Impact installation folder detection.
- One-click startup of GIMI and Genshin Impact.
- Small download size and no installation required.
- Removal of "Run as Admin" prompts from GIMI and Genshin Impact.

### Planned Features
- **Support of FPSUnlocker:** Support FPSUnlocker, another modding tool for Genshin Impact.
- **Profile Managing**: Create different launch profiles, with different settings and mods.
- *More to come in the future.*

## Credits
NeoHanega is just a tool: it only works because other people released their work for everyone to freely use.<br>
In no partcular order, I credit those whose work made Hanega possible:
- **Hoyoverse** for releasing Genshin Impact, a game that to this day nourishes a beautiful community.
- **DarkStarSword, bo3b and Chiri** for making 3DMigoto, a tool that makes modding anticheat-protected games possible.
- **SilentNightSound** for finetuning 3DMigoto into GIMI, without which modding Genshin would've been extremely difficult.

I also want to thank **@Junktion** for helping me catch bugs during development and choosing a cool name for NeoHanega.

And I want to thank you, reader, for using Hanega.
